## Introduction

Dino Jump is an exciting, fast-paced platformer game where you control a cute dinosaur character jumping from cloud to cloud. Test your reflexes and see how high you can climb! This game is developed using React and TypeScript, with the assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model by Anthropic.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Objective** : Jump from cloud to cloud, climbing as high as you can while avoiding falls.
2. **Controls** :

* Use the **Left Arrow** key to move left
* Use the **Right Arrow** key to move right
* Press **Spacebar** to start the game or restart after game over

3. **Scoring** : Each successful jump to a new cloud increases your score by 1 point.
4. **Game Over** : The game ends when you fall off the bottom of the screen.
